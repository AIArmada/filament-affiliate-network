# Filament Affiliate Network Plugin

## Purpose

The `aiarmada/filament-affiliate-network` package is the Filament admin and marketplace adapter for `aiarmada/affiliate-network`.

## What this package owns

- Filament resources for sites, offers, categories, and applications
- Merchant-facing dashboard and affiliate marketplace pages
- Network stats and top-offers widgets
- Filament action workflows for verification, application review, and offer state changes

## What this package does not own

- Site verification logic, link tracking, or offer persistence rules; those stay in `aiarmada/affiliate-network`
- Core affiliate attribution or payout logic; those stay in `aiarmada/affiliates`
- Tenant resolution itself; it consumes the owner context supplied by the host app and `commerce-support`

## Related packages

- [`aiarmada/affiliate-network`](../../affiliate-network/docs/01-overview.md) — core marketplace and tracking package
- [`aiarmada/affiliates`](../../affiliates/docs/01-overview.md) — affiliate identities and commission domain layer
- [`aiarmada/filament-affiliates`](../../filament-affiliates/docs/01-overview.md) — complementary affiliate admin and portal UI

## Main models services or surfaces

- **Resources** — sites, offers, offer categories, and offer applications
- **Pages** — merchant dashboard and affiliate marketplace
- **Widgets** — network stats and top offers

## Owner scoping and security notes

- The plugin should mirror the owner and relationship-scoping rules defined by `aiarmada/affiliate-network`
- Marketplace and admin filters are not authorization; action handlers still need the backing domain package to validate application, offer, and site ownership before mutating records

The `aiarmada/filament-affiliate-network` plugin provides a complete Filament v5 admin interface for managing the affiliate network marketplace.

## Features

- **Site Management** - Register and verify merchant domains with status tracking
- **Offer Management** - Create and manage affiliate offers with commission configuration
- **Category Management** - Organize offers in hierarchical categories
- **Application Review** - Approve/reject/revoke affiliate applications with workflow actions
- **Marketplace Page** - Affiliates browse, search, and apply for offers
- **Merchant Dashboard** - Analytics with pending applications and top offers
- **Network Stats Widget** - Overview statistics (sites, offers, clicks, conversions, revenue)
- **Top Offers Widget** - Performance table of best-performing offers

## Relationship to Core Affiliates

This plugin sits on top of `aiarmada/affiliate-network`, which in turn depends on the `Affiliate` model from `aiarmada/affiliates`.

The UI surfaces here manage network-specific entities such as:

- merchant sites
- offers
- offer applications
- offer links and their aggregated metrics

They do not directly depend on the newer core affiliates conversion/link field names (`external_reference`, `value_minor`, subject-aware tracking fields), so no code changes were required for the recent affiliates package update.
